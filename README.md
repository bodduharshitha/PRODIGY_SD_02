A java program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. 
This program prompts the user to input their guess, compare it to the generated number, and provide feedback if the guess is too high or too low. 
It will then continue until the user correctly guesses the number and then display the number of attempts it took to win the game.

This guessing game, implemented in Java, holds significance as an engaging and interactive application. 
It not only showcases the fundamental principles of programming, such as user input, conditional statements, and loop structures, but also provides users with an enjoyable experience. 
The challenge of guessing a randomly generated number not only entertains but also promotes problem-solving and perseverance. 
By offering immediate feedback on each guess, the program enhances the user's ability to analyze information and make informed decisions. 
Additionally, tracking and displaying the number of attempts required to win the game introduces an element of competition and 
encourages users to refine their strategies, making it a valuable and entertaining learning tool.

Why JAVA ?

Platform Independence: Java's "write once, run anywhere" philosophy allows games to be developed on one platform and 
run on various devices without modification, contributing to flexibility in game deployment.

Rich Ecosystem: Java's extensive set of libraries and frameworks, such as JavaFX, provides developers with powerful tools for graphics, user interfaces, and 
networking, facilitating the creation of feature-rich and visually appealing games.

Community Support: Java's large and active developer community ensures a wealth of resources, tutorials, and open-source libraries, 
fostering collaboration and making it easier for game developers to find solutions to challenges encountered during the development process.
